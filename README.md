# [ MODULE : MULTI_MODEL_CLASSIFICATION ]

### [ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
This repository serves as a consolidated analytical environment for benchmarking supervised machine learning architectures across diverse industrial domains. By applying a unified classification framework to both financial and environmental datasets, this module demonstrates the cross-functional utility of high-performance analytics.

### [ REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE ]
1. **Financial Fraud Detection (`classification_tree_svm.ipynb`):**
   * **Objective:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly unbalanced dataset (0.172% fraud rate).
   * **Skill Demonstration:** Class weight balancing and IBM Snap ML acceleration for CPU/GPU performance optimization.
   
2. **Australian Weather Analysis (`ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.jupyterlite.ipynb`):**
   * **Objective:** Predict environmental events utilizing 10 years of historical meteorological telemetry.
   * **Skill Demonstration:** One-Hot Encoding and multi-algorithm benchmarking across KNN, Trees, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
