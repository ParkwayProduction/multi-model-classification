# [ MODULE : MULTI_MODEL_CLASSIFICATION ]

### [ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
This repository serves as a consolidated analytical environment for benchmarking supervised machine learning architectures across diverse industrial domains. By applying a unified classification framework to both financial and environmental datasets, this module demonstrates the cross-functional utility of high-performance analytics.

### [ REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE ]
1. **Financial Fraud Detection (`classification_tree_svm.ipynb`)**:
   * **Objective**: Identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly unbalanced dataset (0.172% fraud rate).
   * **Skill Demonstration**: Class weight balancing, Scikit-Learn integration, and IBM Snap ML acceleration (CPU/GPU).
   
2. **Australian Weather Analysis (`ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.jupyterlite.ipynb`)**:
   * **Objective**: Predict environmental events utilizing 10 years of historical meteorological telemetry.
   * **Skill Demonstration**: One-Hot Encoding, comparative algorithm benchmarking (KNN, Tree, SVM, LR), and multi-metric validation (Jaccard, F1, LogLoss).
