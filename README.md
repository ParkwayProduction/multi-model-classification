# multi-model-classification
Comparative analytic system evaluating Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and SVM for environmental predictive intelligence

[ MODULE : MULTI_MODEL_CLASSIFICATION ]
[ MISSION_OVERVIEW ]
Deployment of a comprehensive classification benchmark system. This module processes historical meteorological data to predict environmental events, specifically benchmarking the performance of five distinct supervised learning architectures.

[ ANALYTICAL_STRIKE_FORCE ]
Linear & Logistic Regression: Benchmarked for baseline trend analysis.

K-Nearest Neighbors & Decision Trees: Evaluated for non-linear pattern recognition.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Tested for high-dimensional class separation.

[ STATUS: COMPLETED_STRIKE ] [ ENCRYPTION: TLS_VERIFIED ]
